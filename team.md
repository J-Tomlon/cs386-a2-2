Hello, I am a Data Science major here at NAU. I enjoy the outdoors apart
from school and I am the NAU Division 3 Ice Hockey Team captain.

Hey, it's Rylan. I'm a data science undergrad at NAU. I like to cook and play video games (though I don't cook nearly as much as I'd like). I'm currently playing through Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and dealing with the repercussions of emailing someone from the university IT that immediately emailed the leadership of my college requesting a project proposal.

Chris Reger

Hello all. I'm Chris (Karl), a Data Science undergraduate senior, though I'm a tiny bit older than most of my peers. I'm glad I'm not in Rylan's shoes, and I can't think of a single time when emailing IT has ended well.
