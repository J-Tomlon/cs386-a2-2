Hello, I am a Data Science major here at NAU. I enjoy the outdoors apart
from school and I am the captain for the NAU Division 3 Ice Hockey Team.

Hey, it's Rylan. I'm a data science undergrad at NAU. I like to cook and play video games (though I don't cook nearly as much as I'd like). I'm currently playing through Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and dealing with the repercussions of emailing someone from the university IT that immediately emailed the leadership of my college requesting a project proposal.
